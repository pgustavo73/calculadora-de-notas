# 1ยบ Fist app with Kotlin 

Hello welcome

This was everis BootCAmp's first Android Studio class at DIO.

In this exercise, we should develop a simple grading calculator that allows us to calculate the average of a student and tell if they failed or not.

I made some changes on my own.

Feel free to look, I am open to tips and suggestions.
